# SIA Travel Guide Project

## Project Description
SIA Travel Guide is a web application designed to help users plan and organize their travels. It features a user-friendly interface that allows users to toggle between day and night modes, explore popular destinations, and access a contact form for personalized travel assistance.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can log in and log out. The username is saved in local storage for session persistence across page reloads.
- **Theme Preferences**: The application supports a day/night mode toggle, and the selected mode is stored in local storage, so it persists even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
- **Destination Filter**: Users can select a destination from a dropdown menu, and their choice is saved in local storage, allowing it to persist across sessions.

## How User Preferences are Managed
The application uses local storage to store user data, including authentication status, theme preferences, and filter settings. This ensures that user preferences persist across page reloads and enhance the overall user experience.
